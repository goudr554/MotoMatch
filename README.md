🏍️ MotoMatch – Bike Recommendation System
MotoMatch is a Python-based application that helps users find motorcycles based on their preferred engine capacity (CC range) and price range, across different bike categories.
The project focuses on filtering and recommending bikes efficiently using structured data and backend logic.

📌 Project Overview
Choosing the right bike can be difficult when there are many options across different price and engine ranges.
MotoMatch simplifies this process by allowing users to:

Select a minimum and maximum CC range
Select a minimum and maximum price range
Get matching bikes across any bike type
This project demonstrates practical skills in data filtering, backend logic, and application design.

⚙️ Key Features
Filter bikes by engine capacity (min CC – max CC)
Filter bikes by price range (min price – max price)
Supports multiple bike types
Clean and efficient filtering logic
Scalable design for adding more filters in the future

🛠 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (data handling & filtering)
Supabase (PostgreSQL) – data storage
SQL
python-dotenv
